## ✅ Task 1: Define Churn Criteria and Label Customers

### Churn Definitions

**90-Day Churn Threshold:**
- **Definition:** Customers with no purchase in last 90 days
- **Churned:** 11,482 customers (65.93%)
- **Active:** 5,934 customers (34.07%)
- **Selected as primary target** for modeling

**180-Day Churn Threshold:**
- **Definition:** Customers with no purchase in last 180 days
- **Churned:** 6,914 customers (39.70%)
- **Active:** 10,502 customers (60.30%)

**Reference Date:** June 30, 2017 (last date in dataset)

### Class Imbalance Challenge

**Imbalance Ratio:** 65.93% churned vs 34.07% active
- **Challenge:** Majority class (churned) could dominate predictions
- **Solution:** SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
- **Result:** Balanced training set with 50-50 distribution

---

## ✅ Task 2: Feature Engineering

### Feature Set: 22 Total Features

#### 1. RFM & Behavioral Features (10 features)

**Core RFM:**
1. **Recency_Days** - Days since last purchase (most important: 57% importance)
2. **Frequency** - Total number of purchases
3. **Monetary** - Total lifetime revenue

**Derived Behavioral:**
4. **AvgTransactionValue** - Average revenue per order
5. **TotalLifetimeValue** - Same as Monetary (for clarity)
6. **CustomerLifetime_Days** - Days from first to last purchase
7. **AvgDaysBetweenPurchases** - Average gap between orders
8. **PurchaseFrequency** - Inverse of avg days between purchases
9. **RevenueTrend** - Revenue per day of lifetime
10. **EngagementScore** - Composite score (0-1) combining RFM (31% importance)

**Formula:**
```
EngagementScore = (Frequency_normalized × 0.4) +
                  (1 - Recency_normalized × 0.3) +
                  (Monetary_normalized × 0.3)
```

#### 2. Demographic Features (9 features)

**Gender:**
- Gender_M (Male)
- Gender_F (Female)

**Marital Status:**
- Marital_Married
- Marital_Single

**Home Ownership:**
- Is_HomeOwner

**Income:**
- AnnualIncome (numeric, $)
- Income_HighEarner (above median)

**Family:**
- TotalChildren (count)
- Has_Children (boolean)

**Also encoded but lower importance:**
- Education Level (one-hot encoded)
- Occupation (one-hot encoded)

#### 3. Product Preference Features (3 features)

**Category Spending:**
- CategorySpend_Bikes (1.6% importance)
- CategorySpend_Accessories
- CategorySpend_Clothing
- CategorySpend_Components

These capture which product categories each customer prefers.

## ✅ Task 3: Handle Class Imbalance

### SMOTE Application

**Before SMOTE:**
- Class 0 (Active): 4,747 samples (34.07%)
- Class 1 (Churned): 9,185 samples (65.93%)
- **Imbalance ratio:** 1.94:1

**After SMOTE:**
- Class 0 (Active): 9,185 samples (50.00%)
- Class 1 (Churned): 9,185 samples (50.00%)
- **Total training samples:** 18,370 (up from 13,932)

**How SMOTE Works:**
1. Creates synthetic samples of minority class
2. Interpolates between existing minority samples
3. Balances the dataset for better model learning

**Additional Balancing:**
- **Logistic Regression:** `class_weight='balanced'` parameter
- **Random Forest:** `class_weight='balanced'` parameter
- **XGBoost:** `scale_pos_weight` calculated automatically

---

## ✅ Task 4: Model Training

### Train-Test Split

- **Total Customers:** 17,416
- **Train Set:** 13,932 customers (80%)
- **Test Set:** 3,484 customers (20%)
- **Stratified:** Maintains class distribution in both sets

**Feature Scaling:**
- Method: StandardScaler (z-score normalization)
- Applied to all numeric features
- Fitted on training data only (avoid data leakage)
