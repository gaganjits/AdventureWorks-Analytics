---

### Recommendation Algorithm

**Collaborative Filtering Process:**
```
1. Create user-item purchase matrix (17,416 × 130)
2. Calculate item-item similarity using cosine similarity
3. For each customer:
   a. Get purchased products
   b. Find similar products based on similarity matrix
   c. Weight by purchase frequency
   d. Exclude already purchased items
   e. Return top 5 recommendations
```

**Market Basket Analysis:**
```
1. Group products by order
2. Count product pair co-occurrences
3. Calculate:
   - Support = P(A ∩ B)
   - Confidence = P(B|A)
   - Lift = Support / (P(A) × P(B))
4. Filter pairs with minimum support (1%)
5. Rank by lift (higher = stronger association)
```

## Limitations & Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Sample Size for Recommendations**
   - Generated for 1,000 customers (5.7%)
   - **Mitigation:** Batch process all customers weekly

2. **Static Segments**
   - Segments don't auto-update
   - **Mitigation:** Re-run segmentation monthly

3. **Cold Start Problem**
   - New customers have no recommendations
   - **Mitigation:** Use popular items or demographic-based fallbacks

4. **Sparsity**
   - User-item matrix is 97.58% sparse
   - **Mitigation:** Use hybrid approach (collaborative + content-based)
