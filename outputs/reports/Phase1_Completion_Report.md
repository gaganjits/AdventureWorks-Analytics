## ✅ Task 3: Data Quality Checks

### 3.1 Missing Value Analysis ✓

**Summary:**
| Dataset | Total Cells | Missing Cells | Missing % |
|---------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| Sales | 448,368 | 0 | 0.00% |
| Sales_Enriched | 2,297,886 | 26,878 | 1.17% |
| Customers | 235,924 | 260 | 0.11% |
| Products | 3,223 | 50 | 1.55% |
| Returns | 7,236 | 0 | 0.00% |
| Customer_RFM | 452,816 | 2,573 | 0.57% |

**Missing Value Details:**
- **ProductColor:** Some products don't have color attribute (valid - not all products have colors)
- **Customer Prefix & Gender:** <1% missing (acceptable)
- **StdOrderValue:** Missing for single-order customers (valid - need 2+ orders for std dev)

**Conclusion:** ✅ Missing values are minimal and logically explained. No data quality issues.

### 3.2 Outlier Detection ✓

**Revenue Outliers:**
- Method: IQR (Interquartile Range)
- Outliers Detected: 13,929 transactions (24.85%)
- Normal Range: -$201 to $375
- Maximum Revenue: $3,578
- **Status:** High-value transactions are legitimate (bikes, premium products)

**Customer Spending Outliers:**
- Outliers Detected: 1,018 customers (5.85%)
- Normal Range: -$3,210 to $5,537
- Maximum Customer Spend: $12,408
- **Status:** VIP/high-value customers are real, not errors

**Action:** Outliers retained as they represent genuine high-value transactions

### 3.3 Data Consistency Validation ✓

**Validation Checks Performed:**

✅ **No Negative Values:**
- OrderQuantity: 0 negative values
- Revenue: 0 negative values
- Profit: 0 negative values (some low margins are valid)

✅ **No Duplicates:**
- Duplicate sales rows: 0
- Duplicate customer IDs: 0

✅ **Key Integrity:**
- Missing ProductKey: 0
- Missing CustomerKey: 0
- Missing TerritoryKey: 0
- All foreign key relationships intact

⚠️ **Date Inconsistency Found:**
- Orders after stock date: 56,046 (all records)
- **Explanation:** StockDate appears to be product introduction date, not fulfillment date
- **Action:** Not a data quality issue - field misnamed, no correction needed

**Conclusion:** ✅ Data is consistent and ready for modeling
