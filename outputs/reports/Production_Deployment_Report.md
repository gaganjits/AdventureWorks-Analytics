1. REST API for model predictions
2. Real-time churn scoring in CRM
3. User authentication (OAuth)
4. Email report distribution
5. Mobile-optimized views

**Medium-Term (3-6 months):**
6. Customer segmentation (K-means clustering)
7. Product recommendation system
8. "What-if" scenario analysis
9. Anomaly detection alerts
10. Integration with Power BI/Tableau

**Long-Term (6-12 months):**
11. Natural language queries ("Show high-risk products in Q3")
12. Predictive prescriptions (automated recommendations)
